An introduction to the programming and application of machine learning, with a focus on deep learning.
By the end of the course, students will be able to implement deep neural networks to perform classification
on image, text, and other types of data. Students will also have a high-level understanding of deep
neural network models used to generate images, such as autoencoders and GANs. We will focus on
implementations in Python, using Numpy and PyTorch.
Course
Material
You will need to log into Quercus with your UTORid to gain access to course material, and obtain
regular course information (e.g., downloading lecture materials, lab handouts, project information, etc.),
submit work, receive grade/feedback and email announcements
